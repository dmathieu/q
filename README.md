# Q

A very simple (and probably not production-ready) background worker for Go app.

## Usage

There are two modes you can use Q with. "basic" and "expert".  
The basic mode will handle everything for you, while the expert one will allow you to finetune the behavior a lot more.
The basic mode is a wrapper around the expert mode.

* [Example for the basic mode](examples/basic)
* [Example for the expert mode](examples/expert)
